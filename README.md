`shell-command+.el`
===================

`shell-command+` is a `shell-command` substitute that makes it easier
to run commands on regions or whole buffers, among other things.

`shell-command+` has been based on a function named `bang` by [Leah
Neukirchen][leah].

How to use
----------

`shell-command+` is available from [ELPA]. It can be installed by
invoking

	M-x package-install RET shell-command+ RET

Bind the command `shell-command+` to any key, for example `M-!`.

Using [`setup`][setup] I configure `shell-command+` as so:

~~~elisp
(setup (:package shell-command+)
  (:option shell-command+-prompt "$ ")
  (:bind-into dired "M-!" shell-command+)
  (:global "M-!" shell-command+))
~~~
