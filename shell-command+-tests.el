;;; Commentary:

;; Tests for the `shell-command+' parsers.
;;
;; FIXME: Due to the changes in 93233c9g a number of tests have been
;; disabled (see 834c026) that made implicit assumptions on the
;; internal structure of the code.  These tests should eventually be
;; added back to improve the automated testing.
